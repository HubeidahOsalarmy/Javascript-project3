     <h1>Hijab in Islam</h1>
     <p>Islam has strongly emphasized the concept of decency and modesty in the interaction between members of the opposite sex. Dress code is part of that overall teaching. More generally, hijab is used to describe modest behavior and the Quran does indeed prescribe modesty in clothing for both men and women.</p>

        <h2>Why hijab is important in Islam!!!</h2>
        <p>Hijab, or veil represents a woman's submission to her Creator and her connection with the faith. While referring to it, Allah Almighty says: "That is more suitable that they will be known..." But, while hijab is a symbol, in reality it is much more than that.</p>
